# aor-feathers-client

We renamed this project, now it is called **ra-data-feathers** following the react-admin data provider naming.

Please go to [ra-data-feathers](https://github.com/josx/ra-data-feathers)


> You still can use npm to install it, but versions <  2.0.5, for newer use ra-data-feathers.
